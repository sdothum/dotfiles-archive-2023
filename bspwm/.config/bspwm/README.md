# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles referenced in
[the darnedest thing](http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon), and then
some.

## warning

At the time of this README, herbstluftwm has become my tiling wm of 
choice. As such, I have not continued to maintain this bspwm 
configuration to ensure its integration with the remaining scripts in 
this dotfile repository. Some minor tweaking may be necessary.

## caveats

Many of the configuration files contain custom keybind specifications for various
applications and window managers. Note that these are tailored for the
Colemake Shift-DH layout -- a custom Colemak variant -- described in the
reference url above and use vim mappings (customized) where possible. Redefine these keybinds as required.

## notice

bspwm version 0.9.1+ obsoletes the scripts defined here. Syntax 
conversion will be required with version 0.9.1 and above. The new bspwm 
syntax can be found <a 
href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/wiki/Command-Syntax-Rewrite">here</a>.
