# zsh

Love using zshell for its many powerful shell extensions in interactive
sessions. It is my default user shell. But..

## functions

I have since reverted back to POSIX shell, namely **dash** for all shell
scripting on my systems. Thus, all the functions previously used with
zshell are now defunct and not even loaded by my .zshrc and .zshenv in my zshell sessions!

dash's performance advantages over all shells was leveraged with my
herbstluftwm extensions. While most non-server related scripts do not
effectively benefit from dash syntax, writing all scripts in dash keeps
its limited syntax fresh in my mind -- plus, it's always fun to write
fast concise portable code.

I am not at this time continuing to maintain my zshell
function library, but you are free to use it as desired.
