# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles referenced in
[the darnedest thing](http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon), and then
some.

## warning

At the time of this README, fish has become my interactive shell of 
choice -- and dash, my scripting shell, for performance and POSIX 
conformity. As such, I have not continued to maintain this shell 
configuration and function library to ensure its integration with the 
remaining scripts in this dotfile repository. Some minor tweaking may be 
necessary.
