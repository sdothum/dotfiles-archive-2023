# This file is a sample configuration file for slrnpull.  Such a file must 
# exist in the slrnpull spool directory.

# The syntax of the file is very simple.  
# Any line that is blank or begins with a '#' character will be ignored by 
# slrnpull.  The remaining lines consist of 1-4 fields separated by 
# whitespace (unlike shown here, all four fields must be on the same line):
#
#   NEWSGROUP_NAME  MAX_ARTICLES_TO_RETRIEVE   NUMBER_OF_DAYS_BEFORE_EXPIRE
#   FETCH_HEADERS_ONLY
#
# The first field must contain the name of a newsgroup.  
# 
# The second field denotes the number of articles to retrieve for the 
# newsgroup; if its value is 0, all available articles will
# be retrieved.
# Please note that setting the value to 0 still does not make slrnpull
# retrieve any articles which are older than the last one it already
# fetched in that group.
#
# The third field indicates the number of days after an article is retrieved
# before it will be eligible for deletion.  If this value is 0, articles from
# this group will not expire.
#
# The fourth field can be set to 1 if you want slrnpull to only fetch headers
# for new articles by default. You can then mark individual article bodies for
# download in slrn (see README.offline for details).
#
# If a field is blank, or contains the single character '*', default values
# will apply to the field.  Defaults may be set by a line whose newsgroup
# field is 'default'.  Such a line will denote default values to be applied to 
# the lines following it or until another default is established.

# For example:
default     99  14  0
