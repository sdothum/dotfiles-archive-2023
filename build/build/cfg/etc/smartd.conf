# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.

# Home page is: http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net

# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
# signal

# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.

# You can usually identify which hard disks are on your system by
# looking in /proc/ide and in /proc/scsi.

# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
# configuration file to be ignored: it tells smartd to scan for all
# ATA and SCSI devices.  DEVICESCAN may be followed by any of the
# Directives listed below, which will be applied to all devices that
# are found.  Most users should comment out DEVICESCAN and explicitly
# list the devices that they wish to monitor.
# DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m root -M test
# DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m sdothum@gmail.com -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner -M test

# An ATA disk may appear as a SCSI device to the OS. If a SCSI to

# except for -C and -U, where ID = 0 turns them off.
# All but -d, -m and -M Directives are only implemented for ATA devices
#
# If the test string DEVICESCAN is the first uncommented text
# then smartd will scan for devices /dev/hd[a-l] and /dev/sd[a-z]
# DEVICESCAN may be followed by any desired Directives.
