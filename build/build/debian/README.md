# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles referenced in
[the darnedest thing](http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon), and then
some.

## warning

At the time of this README, Arch Linux has become my Linux distribution 
of choice. As such, I have not continued to maintain this debian 
configuration to ensure its integration with the remaining scripts in 
this dotfile repository. Some minor tweaking may be necessary.
